/**

 * <p>{@link #readAllBounded(InputStream, long)} reads a stream without letting it grow past a byte limit. A body of
 * known length is read straight into one buffer sized from the announced length, up to 8 MiB. A body of unknown length
 * is read into a list of chunks and copied once into the result. The result is always one {@code byte[]}, so the
 * effective limit never exceeds {@link #MAX_BUFFER_BYTES} (the largest array the JVM reliably allocates) even when a
 * larger limit is passed; a longer stream then fails with {@link BoundedReadLimitException} instead of an
 * {@link OutOfMemoryError}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #closeSuppressing(AutoCloseable, Throwable)} closes a resource while keeping the failure that caused the
